# PLUGINS 

## This plugin provides additional completions not available in Zsh yet.
zsh-users/zsh-completions

## This plugin allows you to type part of a command which exists in the history, and then select matching commands with specific keys, for example, to select with up and down arrow keys, we need to add the following configuration:
zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search

## This plugin will suggest commands as you type, which you can select with the right arrow key (➡). The suggestions are based on the history.
zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions

## This plugin provides syntax highlighting for the commands we type in the Terminal. In addition, when we’re typing a command, it’ll be highlighted in red if it’s invalid and in green, if it’s valid.
